**Front End Framework**: REACT JS
**Testing Framework**: TESTING LIBRARY
**End-to-End Testing Framework**: CYPRESS

I'm using React JS due to familiarity and work mostly on React. For testing library using **testing-library come with react (jest)** for unit testing as it is already come with the Create React App project.

For End-to-End testing I'm using cypress as more familiarity with it and easy to use.

The approach I take to build this web app :

1.  Identifying the structure and flow of the web app
2.  Structuring the website design into smaller part components to plan out the reusable components
3.  Using the create components to build the pages for the web app

**State Management**
I'm using **React Context API** for the state management. I'm choosing the Context API as state management framwork due to its simplicity and already come with react. So I can eliminate dependency with third party library. Also with Context API it is much easier to compare to other state management library like Redux
